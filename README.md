# KeyGengeration
Bash script that lets you create ECC and RSA Keys.

The script will ask you how many keys you require and then the alias you wish to create the keys, it will then go into key sizes and also will log the alias of the keys and expiry date, by creating a log file.

Key_Example1: 2025-11-07 (Size: 3272 bytes)
Key Example2: 2024-11-10 (Size: 956 bytes)

You will also have the ability to sign the keys with a root CA or just remain them as self-signed.

This is a nice little bit of script that allows you to play with different key sizes and also has the ability to be improved and grow.
